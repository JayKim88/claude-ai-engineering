# AI Digest Plugin

Digest AI/tech articles and content into structured learning documents for quick reference and practical application.

## Overview

With the rapid pace of AI development, keeping track of new features, changes, and best practices is challenging. The AI Digest plugin helps you capture and organize AI/tech content from articles, blog posts, and announcements into structured, searchable learning documents.

## Features

- **URL Analysis**: Fetch and analyze articles directly from URLs
- **Direct Content**: Paste article text for immediate analysis
- **Focused Extraction**: Specify what to focus on (e.g., "breaking changes only")
- **AI-Optimized Template**: Structured format for quick reference
- **Bilingual Support**: Korean/English documentation
- **Git Integration**: Auto-commit and push (optional)
- **Shared Config**: Reuses learning-summary configuration

## Installation

### For Users: Install via npx

```bash
# Install from repository
npx github:JayKim88/claude-ai-engineering ai-digest
```

### For Developers: Local Development

```bash
# Clone and link
cd ~/Documents/Projects
git clone https://github.com/JayKim88/claude-ai-engineering.git
cd claude-ai-engineering
npm run link
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Digest article from URL
/ai-digest https://anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5

# Analyze with specific focus
/ai-digest "Focus on API changes" https://docs.anthropic.com/...

# Digest pasted content
/ai-digest "Analyze this: [paste your article text]"
```

### Alternative Trigger Phrases

```bash
# English
"digest this article" + URL
"analyze this AI news" + URL
"summarize this tech blog" + URL

# Korean
"이 글 정리해줘" + URL
"AI 뉴스 요약" + URL
"기술 블로그 분석" + URL
```

## Document Structure

Generated documents include:

```markdown
# Article Title

> **Source**: [URL]
> **Date**: 2026-01-25
> **Tags**: #ai #topic

## 요약 (Summary)
Brief overview in Korean

## 주요 변경사항 / 새로운 개념 (Key Changes/Concepts)
- What changed or what's new
- Why it matters
- Impact on your work

## 실무 적용 방법 (Practical Applications)
How to use this in real projects

## 코드 예제 (Code Examples)
Runnable code snippets with explanations

## Before/After 비교 (if applicable)
Migration guides and comparisons

## 주의사항 / 제한사항 (Limitations)
Important warnings and gotchas

## 참고 링크 (References)
Original URL and related resources

## Next Steps
Follow-up actions and topics to explore
```

## Configuration

The plugin reuses the learning-summary configuration file.

**Location**: `~/.claude/skills/learning-summary/config.yaml`

```yaml
# Dedicated AI learning repository
learning_repo: "/Users/username/Documents/Projects/ai-learning"

# Auto-commit to git
auto_commit: false

# Auto-push to remote (requires auto_commit: true)
auto_push: false
```

**Note**: ai-digest always saves to the `digests/` subfolder (not `learnings/`) to separate article digests from conversation summaries.

**If config doesn't exist**, you'll be prompted to provide the learning repository path.

## Examples

### Example 1: Digest Claude Release Notes

```bash
/ai-digest https://anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5
```

**Output**: `/Users/username/Documents/Projects/ai-learning/digests/2026-01-25-ai-claude-sonnet-4-5-release.md`

**Captures:**
- New features and improvements
- Performance benchmarks
- Breaking changes and migrations
- Code examples for new capabilities
- Practical use cases

### Example 2: Focus on Specific Aspects

```bash
/ai-digest "Focus on breaking changes and migration" https://openai.com/blog/gpt-5
```

**Result**: Document emphasizes:
- API breaking changes
- Deprecated features
- Migration steps with code examples
- Compatibility notes

### Example 3: Batch Processing

```bash
# Process multiple articles in one session
/ai-digest https://anthropic.com/news/article-1
/ai-digest https://openai.com/blog/article-2
/ai-digest https://langchain.com/blog/article-3
```

Each article is saved as a separate document in your ai-learning repository.

## Output Location

Documents are saved to:

```
{learning_repo}/digests/YYYY-MM-DD-ai-[topic].md
```

**Example**:
```
/Users/jaykim/Documents/Projects/ai-learning/
├── learnings/                    # conversation summaries (learning-summary)
└── digests/                      # article digests (ai-digest)
    ├── 2026-01-25-ai-claude-sonnet-4-5-release.md
    ├── 2026-01-25-ai-openai-gpt5-features.md
    └── 2026-01-25-ai-langchain-updates.md
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Daily AI News Digest

Stay up-to-date with rapid AI developments:

```bash
# Morning routine
/ai-digest https://anthropic.com/news/latest
/ai-digest https://openai.com/blog/recent
```

### 2. Project-Specific Research

Capture relevant information for current projects:

```bash
/ai-digest "Focus on production deployment" https://docs.anthropic.com/production
```

### 3. Learning New Concepts

Build a personal knowledge base:

```bash
/ai-digest https://blog.example.com/understanding-transformers
/ai-digest https://blog.example.com/rag-patterns
```

## Tips

1. **Use Descriptive Focus**: Specify what you want to extract
   - "Focus on breaking changes"
   - "Extract code examples only"
   - "Summarize key features"

2. **Batch Similar Topics**: Process related articles together for better context

3. **Enable Auto-commit**: Set `auto_commit: true` for automatic version control

4. **Tag Consistently**: Documents include tags for easier searching later

5. **Review Generated Docs**: Edit documents to add personal notes in the "메모" section

## Differences from learning-summary

| Feature | ai-digest | learning-summary |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Input** | URL or article text | Current conversation |
| **Focus** | AI/tech content | General learning |
| **Output Folder** | `digests/` | `learnings/` |
| **Template** | AI-specific sections | Generic learning sections |
| **Use Case** | Rapid info capture | Session summary |
| **When to Use** | New articles, updates | End of conversation |

**Together**: Use both plugins for comprehensive learning documentation:
- `ai-digest`: Capture external content
- `learning-summary`: Document conversations

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: URL fetch fails

**Solution**: Paste the article content directly:
```bash
/ai-digest "Analyze this: [paste full article text]"
```

### Issue: Config not found

**Solution**: Create config file or provide path when prompted:
```yaml
# ~/.claude/skills/learning-summary/config.yaml
learning_repo: "/path/to/your/ai-learning"
auto_commit: false
auto_push: false
```

### Issue: Document not saved

**Solution**: Check directory permissions:
```bash
ls -la /path/to/ai-learning/digests
```

### Issue: Git commit fails

**Cause**: Not a git repository

**Solution**: Initialize git:
```bash
cd /path/to/ai-learning
git init
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
```

## Workflow Integration

### Daily Learning Routine

```bash
# 1. Collect AI news URLs during the day
# 2. At end of day, batch process:
/ai-digest https://url1
/ai-digest https://url2
/ai-digest https://url3

# 3. Review generated documents
cd ~/Documents/Projects/ai-learning/digests
ls -lt | head -10  # See recent docs

# 4. Commit manually or let auto_commit handle it
git add .
git commit -m "Daily AI updates: 2026-01-25"
git push
```

### Project Research

```bash
# Research specific topic
/ai-digest "Focus on implementation details" https://blog.example.com/rag-systems
/ai-digest "Extract performance metrics" https://blog.example.com/rag-benchmarks

# Document your experiments
# (Use learning-summary for conversation notes)
```
