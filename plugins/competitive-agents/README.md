# Competitive Agents

Two AI agents with different philosophies compete to generate a Claude Code plugin. Through cross-review and improvement rounds, the quality of both implementations rises. A judge evaluates the final results and the user picks the winner.

## How It Works

```
Mission → Parallel Generation (Alpha vs Beta)
       → Cross-Review → Improvement (x1-2 rounds)
       → Judge Evaluation → User Decision
```

**Agent Alpha (Pragmatist)**: Simplicity, minimal files, works immediately.
**Agent Beta (Architect)**: Completeness, extensibility, comprehensive docs.

## Installation

```bash
# From the monorepo root
npm run link
```

## Usage

```
"compete"
"competitive agents"
"/compete"
"에이전트 경쟁"
```

### Example

```
User: compete
       → "Build a plugin that summarizes YouTube video transcripts"
       → 1 round

[~4 min later]

Agent Alpha: 4 files, single-skill, 78/100
Agent Beta: 11 files, multi-agent, 82/100
Winner: Beta by 4 points

User: Fuse A + B → Final plugin with best of both
```
