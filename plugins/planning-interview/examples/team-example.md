# Enterprise SSO Integration - Product Requirements Document

**Document Status:** Draft v1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14
**Mode:** Team / Product Manager
**Duration:** 42 min
**Owner:** Alex Martinez, Senior Product Manager
**Stakeholders:** CTO (David Lee), VP Sales (Rachel Kim), Head of Security (James Wong), Head of Customer Success (Maria Garcia)

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) for our B2B SaaS platform to unlock enterprise market segment (1000+ employees) currently representing 45% of our sales pipeline but blocked due to lack of SSO. This feature will enable SAML 2.0 and OIDC authentication, custom user provisioning (SCIM), and audit logging to meet SOC 2 and enterprise security requirements.

**Impact:** Unlock $2M ARR in blocked pipeline, reduce sales cycle for enterprise deals from 6 months to 3 months, achieve SOC 2 Type II compliance prerequisite.

---

## 1. Background & Context

### Strategic Alignment

**Company OKR (2026 Q2):** Increase enterprise segment revenue to 40% of total ARR (currently 15%)

**Product Roadmap Priority:** P0 (Top priority for Q2)

**Dependencies:**
- Sales: Enterprise deals (Acme Corp $500K ARR, BigCo $400K ARR) on hold pending SSO
- Customer Success: 3 existing mid-market customers ($100K ARR each) expanding to 500+ employees, requesting SSO
- Security: SOC 2 Type II audit in Q3 requires SSO + audit logging

### Business Problem

**Sales friction:** 45% of enterprise sales pipeline ($2M ARR) stalled because:
- IT/Security teams reject tools without SSO (security policy requirement)
- Procurement blocks purchases for apps that don't integrate with Okta/Azure AD
- Average enterprise deal cycle: 6 months (vs. 2 months for mid-market) due to security review delays

**Customer expansion limits:** 3 existing customers growing to 500+ employees hit internal policy wall requiring SSO. At risk of churn if not delivered by Q3.

**Competitive disadvantage:** 80% of competitors (Asana, Monday.com, Notion) offer SSO. We lose deals in final stages to "feature parity" comparisons.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### User Problem

**IT Admins at Enterprise Companies** need centralized control over employee access to third-party SaaS applications to:
- Enforce security policies (2FA, password complexity, access revocation upon termination)
- Comply with regulations (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA depending on industry)
- Reduce IT support burden (employees forget passwords → 20% of helpdesk tickets)
- Audit who accessed what, when (required for security audits)

**Current Situation:**

Without SSO:
- **IT Admins:** Have no visibility into who has access to our platform. When employee leaves, must manually notify us to revoke access (often forgotten → security risk).
- **Employees:** Manage yet another username/password. Password reset requests create support tickets.
- **Security Teams:** Cannot enforce 2FA or session timeout policies centrally. Must audit each SaaS app individually (manual, time-consuming).

**Pain Severity:**
- **IT/Security:** Blocker (10/10 pain) — Will not approve purchase without SSO
- **End Users:** Moderate (5/10 pain) — One more password to remember, but manageable
- **Procurement:** High (8/10 pain) — Cannot complete vendor security review without SSO compliance

---

## 3. Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Enable enterprise customer acquisition and retention by delivering SSO that meets Fortune 500 IT security standards.

**Success Criteria:**

1. **Business:** Close 2 blocked enterprise deals ($900K ARR total) within 30 days of SSO launch
2. **Product:** 80% of enterprise trials (defined as 500+ employees) activate SSO within 7 days of trial start
3. **Technical:** SSO authentication <2 second latency, 99.9% uptime SLA
4. **Security:** Pass SOC 2 Type II audit with zero findings related to authentication/authorization

**Non-Goals (Out of Scope for v1):**

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) — Rely on customer's IdP (Okta, Azure AD) to enforce MFA
- Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning for all users — SCIM only, no automated JIT user creation in v1
- Support for legacy SAML 1.1 or WS-Federation — Only SAML 2.0 and OIDC
- Custom RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) mapping — Use default roles (Admin, Member, Guest) only

---

## 4. Target Users & Market

### Market Size

**Total Enterprise Market (1000+ employees):**
- 30,000 companies in US + Europe
- Average deal size: $200K-500K ARR
- Our SAM: 5,000 companies in our target verticals (finance, healthcare, tech)

**Immediate Pipeline:**
- 15 enterprise prospects ($2M ARR) stalled at security review stage
- 3 existing customers at risk of churn (escalated to exec team)

### User Segments

1. **IT Admins** (Primary): Configure SSO, manage user provisioning, monitor access logs
2. **Security Teams** (Influencer): Review SSO implementation during vendor assessment, ensure compliance
3. **End Users / Employees** (Beneficiary): Log in via SSO, fewer passwords to manage
4. **Procurement / Legal** (Gatekeeper): Approve vendor contracts only if SOC 2 + SSO requirements met

---

## 5. User Personas

### Primary Persona: Sam, IT Administrator

**Role:** IT Administrator / Identity & Access Management (IAM) Specialist

**Demographics:**
- **Company:** Fortune 500 or large enterprise (1000-10,000 employees)
- **Industry:** Finance, healthcare, or technology
- **Team:** Part of 10-30 person IT department
- **Seniority:** 5-10 years in IT, specialist in IAM/SSO

**Goals:**
1. Centrally manage employee access to 50+ SaaS applications from single IdP (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace)
2. Ensure compliance with security policies (enforce 2FA, session timeout, least privilege access)
3. Reduce security risk (immediately revoke access when employee leaves)
4. Minimize support burden (fewer password reset tickets)

**Pain Points:**
- Spends 2 hours per week manually managing access for SaaS apps without SSO (onboarding, offboarding, role changes)
- Security audit findings: "12 SaaS apps lack centralized access control" (Sam's responsibility to fix)
- When employee leaves, must track down all SaaS apps they used and request account deletion (manual, error-prone)
- Shadow IT: Employees sign up for SaaS tools without IT approval because SSO isn't available

**Current Tools:**
- **IdP:** Okta (60% of our market) or Azure Active Directory (30%) or Google Workspace (10%)
- **SCIM:** For user provisioning automation
- **Audit/SIEM:** Splunk or Datadog for security event monitoring

**Quote:**
> "I manage 50+ SaaS apps. If a tool doesn't support SAML or SCIM, it's a hard no from me. I can't manually track who has access to what — that's how breaches happen."

### Secondary Persona: Chris, Security Analyst

**Role:** Information Security Analyst / Security Engineer

**Goals:**
- Ensure all SaaS vendors meet security compliance standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR)
- Audit authentication logs for anomalies (unusual login locations, failed attempts)
- Enforce zero-trust architecture (verify every access request)

**Pain:**
- Vendor security reviews take 2-3 weeks. SSO is checkbox #1. If missing, vendor rejected immediately.
- Needs audit logs showing "who logged in, from where, at what time" for compliance reporting

**Quote:**
> "If we can't integrate your app with our SSO, we can't verify you're enforcing our security policies. That's a dealbreaker."

### Tertiary Persona: Jordan, End User (Employee)

**Role:** Product Manager, Marketing Manager, or Sales Rep at enterprise company

**Goals:**
- Access work tools quickly without remembering 15 different passwords
- Not get locked out of accounts when password expires

**Pain:**
- Password fatigue: "I have 20 work logins. I use the same password everywhere or write them down."
- Forgot password: "I waste 10 minutes per week resetting passwords."

**Quote:**
> "I love SSO because I just click 'Sign in with Okta' and I'm in. No password to remember."

## 6. User Stories & Jobs-to-be-Done

### Core User Stories

**As Sam (IT Admin), I want to...**

1. **Configure SSO integration** so that employees can log in using our corporate identity provider (Okta/Azure AD)
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - I can enter SAML metadata URL or upload XML file
     - I can test SSO connection before enabling for all users
     - I see clear error messages if configuration is wrong (e.g., "Certificate expired")
     - Configuration takes <15 minutes (industry standard)

2. **Automatically provision and deprovision users via SCIM** so that I don't manually manage access
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - When I add user to "YourApp" group in Okta, they're auto-created in your platform
     - When I remove user from group, their account is auto-deactivated within 1 hour
     - I can map Okta groups to your platform roles (Admin, Member, Guest)
     - Sync errors are logged and I'm notified via email

3. **View audit logs of all SSO login events** so that I can investigate security incidents
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - I see: username, timestamp, IP address, success/failure, device info
     - I can filter logs by date range, user, success/failure
     - I can export logs as CSV for compliance reporting
     - Logs retained for 1 year minimum (SOC 2 requirement)

**As Chris (Security Analyst), I want to...**

4. **Verify that your SSO implementation meets our security standards** so that I can approve vendor
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - Your SSO supports SAML 2.0 with SHA-256 signatures (not deprecated SHA-1)
     - You enforce session timeout (configurable by us in IdP)
     - You support forced re-authentication for sensitive actions
     - Your SOC 2 report includes SSO in scope

**As Jordan (End User), I want to...**

5. **Log in using my company SSO** so that I don't need another password
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - I see "Sign in with Okta" button on login page
     - After clicking, I'm redirected to Okta, I approve, I'm logged into your app (<5 seconds total)
     - I stay logged in for my work session (8 hours), don't need to re-auth every 30 min
     - If I log out of Okta, I'm also logged out of your app (single logout)

### Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

**When** an employee joins the company,
**I want to** automatically grant them access to all approved SaaS apps via SSO,
**So that** they can start working on day 1 without waiting for IT to manually create 20 accounts.

**When** an employee leaves the company,
**I want to** revoke their access to all SaaS apps in one action (remove from IdP),
**So that** I eliminate security risk of orphaned accounts with lingering access.

**When** I need to generate a compliance report for SOC 2 audit,
**I want to** export authentication logs showing who accessed what systems,
**So that** I can prove we have centralized access control and audit trail.

## 7. Requirements & Prioritization

### MoSCoW Framework

**Must Have (v1.0 — Launch Blockers):**

1. **SAML 2.0 SSO Support**
   - Support both SP-initiated and IdP-initiated flows
   - Support major IdPs: Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, OneLogin
   - SHA-256 signatures (not SHA-1)
   - Encrypted assertions optional but supported

2. **SCIM 2.0 User Provisioning**
   - Create, update, deactivate users automatically
   - Support group-to-role mapping (map Okta group "YourApp Admins" → Admin role)
   - Handle bulk operations (sync 1000+ users on initial setup)

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all SSO authentication events (success + failures)
   - Minimum data: user ID, timestamp, IP address, IdP, success/failure
   - Retention: 1 year
   - Export to CSV

4. **Admin Configuration UI**
   - Self-serve SSO setup wizard for IT admins
   - Test connection before enabling
   - Manage user role mappings

5. **Security Requirements**
   - SOC 2 Type II controls for authentication
   - Support session timeout enforcement from IdP
   - Force SSO for all users (optional setting — "Disable password login")

**Should Have (v1.1 — 1-2 Months Post-Launch):**

1. **Single Logout (SLO)**
   - When user logs out of IdP, trigger logout from our app
   - When user logs out of our app, trigger IdP logout (optional)

2. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning**
   - Auto-create user account on first SSO login (if not already created via SCIM)
   - Use SAML attributes to populate user profile (name, email, role)

3. **Advanced Audit Logging**
   - Integration with customer SIEM (Splunk, Datadog) via webhook
   - Real-time alerts for suspicious activity (e.g., 10 failed login attempts in 5 min)

4. **Multi-IdP Support**
   - Allow multiple SSO providers per organization (e.g., Okta for corporate, Azure AD for contractors)

**Could Have (v2.0 — 6+ Months):**

1. **Custom RBAC Mapping**
   - Map IdP groups to custom roles/permissions (beyond Admin/Member/Guest)
   - Support for attribute-based access control (ABAC)

2. **Self-Service User Management**
   - Let end users view/edit their own profile without admin
   - User can see which groups they belong to

3. **OIDC Support (In Addition to SAML)**
   - For IdPs that prefer OIDC over SAML

**Won't Have (This Version):**

1. **Legacy SAML 1.1 Support** — Deprecated, security risk, not requested
2. **LDAP Integration** — Market moved to cloud IdPs, low demand
3. **Custom MFA** — IdPs handle this, not our responsibility
4. **Mobile App SSO** — Web-only for v1, mobile in v2

---

## 8. User Experience & Design

**Admin Setup Flow:**

1. Admin navigates to Settings → Security → Single Sign-On
2. Toggle "Enable SSO" → Shows setup wizard
3. Select IdP from dropdown (Okta / Azure AD / Google / Custom SAML)
4. Upload SAML metadata (XML file or paste metadata URL)
5. Platform auto-configures based on metadata
6. Admin clicks "Test Connection" → Opens new tab, attempts SSO login, shows success/error
7. If successful, admin sees "Ready to Enable" → Clicks "Enable for All Users"
8. Optional: Toggle "Enforce SSO Only" (disables password login)
9. Redirect to SCIM setup (optional): Shows SCIM endpoint URL + API token to paste into IdP

**End User Login Flow:**

1. User visits app.yourplatform.com/login
2. Sees two options: "Sign in with Email" or "Sign in with SSO"
3. Clicks "Sign in with SSO" → Enters company email (e.g., sam@acmecorp.com)
4. Platform detects Acme Corp has SSO enabled → Redirects to Acme's Okta login
5. User authenticates in Okta (username/password + 2FA if enforced)
6. Okta redirects back to app.yourplatform.com with SAML assertion
7. Platform validates assertion, creates session, redirects to user dashboard
8. Total time: <5 seconds

**Error Handling:**

- **SSO not configured**: Show "Your organization hasn't set up SSO yet. Contact your IT admin or sign in with password."
- **SAML assertion invalid**: "SSO login failed. Please contact your IT admin. Error: Certificate mismatch."
- **User not provisioned**: "Your account hasn't been created yet. Ask your IT admin to add you to the [App Name] group in Okta."

---

## 9. Technical Considerations

**Authentication Flow:**

- Use industry-standard SAML 2.0 library (e.g., `ruby-saml`, `python-saml3`, or SaaS service like Auth0, WorkOS)
- Support both SP-initiated and IdP-initiated flows
- Validate SAML assertions: signature, expiration, audience restriction
- Store IdP metadata in database (per organization)

**SCIM Provisioning:**

- Implement SCIM 2.0 REST API (`/scim/v2/Users`, `/scim/v2/Groups`)
- Support operations: GET (retrieve), POST (create), PATCH (update), DELETE (deactivate)
- Use bearer token authentication for SCIM endpoints (generate unique token per organization)
- Handle rate limiting (SCIM sync can be bursty — 1000+ users in bulk)

**Data Model Changes:**

- Add `organizations` table: `sso_enabled`, `saml_metadata`, `scim_token`, `enforce_sso_only`
- Add `users` table: `sso_provider_id` (maps to IdP user ID), `sso_last_login_at`
- Add `audit_logs` table: `event_type`, `user_id`, `ip_address`, `timestamp`, `metadata`

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:** SSO login <2 seconds (90th percentile), SCIM sync <10 seconds per 100 users
- **Security:** 
  - Encrypt SAML assertions in transit (TLS 1.2+)
  - Hash and salt SCIM tokens
  - Audit all SSO events (success + failures)
  - Support certificate rotation (30-day warning before expiration)
- **Scalability:** Support 10,000 users per organization, 1,000 SSO logins per minute (peak)
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for SSO service (separate from main app SLA if needed)

**Integration Requirements:**

- Must work with Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, OneLogin
- Test with real IdPs during QA (not just mocks)
- Provide setup documentation per IdP (screenshots, step-by-step guides)

**Compliance:**

- SOC 2 Type II controls:
  - Access control (only authorized admins can configure SSO)
  - Audit logging (tamper-proof, 1-year retention)
  - Change management (track who enabled/disabled SSO)
- GDPR: Audit logs contain PII (IP addresses) → Must support data deletion requests

## 10. Success Metrics & KPIs

### North Star Metric

**Enterprise SSO Adoption Rate:** % of enterprise customers (500+ employees) with SSO enabled within 30 days of trial start

**Target:** 70% by end of Q3 2026

**Why:** High adoption indicates SSO is easy to set up and delivers value. Low adoption suggests friction in setup or lack of awareness.

### Instrumentation Plan

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeline | Tracking Method |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Enterprise SSO Adoption** | 0% (no SSO today) | 70% | Q3 2026 | Track `organizations.sso_enabled` for enterprises |
| **SSO Setup Completion Time** | N/A | <15 min (p90) | Q2 2026 | Track time from "Start Setup" to "Enable for All Users" |
| **SSO Login Success Rate** | N/A | >99% | Q2 2026 | `successful_sso_logins / total_sso_attempts` from audit logs |
| **Enterprise Deals Closed** | 2/quarter (without SSO) | 6/quarter | Q3 2026 | Salesforce opportunity tracking with "SSO" tag |
| **SCIM Provisioning Errors** | N/A | <1% error rate | Q2 2026 | SCIM API error logs, alert if >5 errors/hour |
| **Support Tickets (SSO-related)** | 0 (no SSO) | <10/month | Q3 2026 | Zendesk tag "SSO" |
| **Audit Log Exports** | N/A | 50+ exports/month | Q3 2026 | Track CSV export downloads (indicates compliance usage) |

### Product-Market Fit Indicators

**We've achieved PMF for enterprise segment when:**

1. **Sales cycle reduction**: Enterprise deals close in 3 months vs. 6 months pre-SSO
2. **Win rate increase**: Enterprise win rate increases from 20% to 40%+ (SSO was top objection)
3. **Expansion**: 3 at-risk customers ($300K ARR total) renew and expand contracts
4. **Competitive wins**: Sales reports 5+ competitive wins where SSO was deciding factor
5. **Organic demand**: 20+ inbound enterprise leads mention SSO as reason for interest

## 12. Risks, Assumptions & Dependencies

### Top Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **IdP integration breaks** (e.g., Okta changes API) | Medium | High (customers can't log in) | Use stable SAML 2.0 standard (rarely changes), monitor IdP changelog, maintain test suite with real IdPs |
| **SCIM sync causes data loss** (e.g., accidentally deletes all users) | Low | Critical | Implement soft-delete (deactivate, don't delete), require admin confirmation for bulk operations, maintain audit log |
| **SSO setup too complex, customers churn** | Medium | High (defeats purpose if no one uses it) | Invest in UX testing with real IT admins, provide step-by-step guides per IdP, offer white-glove onboarding for first 10 customers |
| **Security vulnerability in SAML implementation** | Low | Critical (breach, regulatory fines) | Use battle-tested library (not custom), penetration testing before launch, bug bounty program, SOC 2 audit coverage |
| **Timeline slips, enterprise deals lost** | Medium | High ($2M pipeline at risk) | Build MVP first (SAML only, SCIM in v1.1 if needed), timebox to 8 weeks, cut scope if necessary to hit Q2 launch |

### Key Assumptions

1. **Assumption:** IT admins can self-serve SSO setup without sales engineer support
   - **Validation:** Beta test with 3 design partners, measure setup time and support ticket volume

2. **Assumption:** SAML 2.0 + SCIM 2.0 is sufficient (don't need OIDC, LDAP, other protocols)
   - **Validation:** Sales team surveyed 15 enterprise prospects → 100% use Okta/Azure AD/Google, all support SAML + SCIM

3. **Assumption:** Customers want to enforce SSO-only (disable password login)
   - **Validation:** User interviews with 5 IT admins → 4/5 said "yes, we mandate SSO for all apps"

4. **Assumption:** We can build this in 8 weeks with 2 engineers
   - **Validation:** CTO reviewed scope, compared to similar implementations at previous companies, confirmed feasible

5. **Assumption:** Blocked enterprise deals will close within 30 days of SSO launch
   - **Validation:** Sales confirmed with Acme Corp and BigCo: "SSO is only blocker, we're ready to sign once it's live"

### Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies:**

- **Engineering:** Need 2 backend engineers for 8 weeks (SSO implementation + SCIM API)
- **Design:** Need 1 designer for 1 week (admin setup wizard UI)
- **Security:** Need security team to review implementation before beta launch (Week 2)
- **Customer Success:** Need CSM to onboard design partners and collect feedback (Weeks 3-6)
- **Sales:** Need sales team to re-engage blocked pipeline after launch (Week 7+)
- **Legal:** Need legal to review updated DPA (data processing agreement) for SCIM data flow

**External Dependencies:**

- **IdP Vendors:** Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace APIs must remain stable (low risk, SAML is mature standard)
- **Design Partners:** Need 3 customers willing to beta test (already committed: Acme Corp, BigCo, MegaBank)
- **SOC 2 Auditor:** Need auditor approval that SSO implementation meets Type II controls (audit in Q3)
