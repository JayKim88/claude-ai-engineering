## Own Problem Validation (MAKE Methodology)

<!-- Indie Maker Principle: The best products solve YOUR OWN problem. Validate that this idea comes from genuine personal experience, not from trend-chasing or "solution in search of a problem". -->

**Is this YOUR problem?**
- [ ] I personally experience this problem regularly
- [ ] I have tried existing solutions and found them lacking
- [ ] I can describe the last time I faced this problem in detail
- [ ] This problem keeps coming back to my mind over weeks/months

**Problem Origin:**
{{PROBLEM_ORIGIN}}
<!-- Example: "I was frustrated trying to find reliable wifi cafes while traveling in Lisbon" -->

**If NOT your problem, why are you qualified?**
{{QUALIFICATION_REASON}}

## Micro-Niche Strategy

<!-- Start with the smallest possible niche. Dominate it. Then expand. Example: Nomad List started for "digital nomads" (tiny niche) → expanded to "remote workers" → "general travelers & expats" (1000x larger market) -->

**Micro-Niche (Start Here):**
{{MICRO_NICHE}}
<!-- The smallest, most specific audience. "Digital nomads in Southeast Asia" not "travelers" -->

**Expansion Path:**
1. **Niche Level 1 (Month 1-6):** {{NICHE_LEVEL_1}} — {{NICHE_1_SIZE_ESTIMATE}}
2. **Niche Level 2 (Month 6-12):** {{NICHE_LEVEL_2}} — {{NICHE_2_SIZE_ESTIMATE}}
3. **Broad Market (Year 2+):** {{BROAD_MARKET}} — {{BROAD_MARKET_SIZE}}

**Niche Validation:**
- Where does this niche hang out online? {{NICHE_COMMUNITY}}
- What do they currently use? {{NICHE_CURRENT_TOOLS}}
- Would 100 people in this niche pay $X/month? {{NICHE_WILLINGNESS_TO_PAY}}

## Idea Source Check

<!-- Avoid "Solution in Search of a Problem". Technology/trends should NOT be the starting point. -->

**Idea Origin Type:**
- [ ] Problem-first: Started from a real frustration/pain (GOOD)
- [ ] Technology-first: Started from "I want to use AI/blockchain/etc" (RISKY)
- [ ] Trend-first: Started from "X is hot right now" (RISKY)
- [ ] Copy-first: Started from "Competitor X is successful, I'll copy" (RISKY)

**If Technology/Trend/Copy-first, reframe:**
{{REFRAME_TO_PROBLEM}}
<!-- Force yourself to articulate the PROBLEM, not the solution -->
