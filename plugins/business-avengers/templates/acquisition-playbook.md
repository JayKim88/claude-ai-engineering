## First Contact Protocol

### When You Receive an Acquisition Inquiry

**Step 1: Don't Get Emotional (First 24 Hours)**

- **Do NOT immediately respond** with excitement or detailed numbers
- **Do NOT share financial data** in the first email
- **Do take time** to assess if this is serious
- **Do consult** with your advisor/attorney before responding

**Initial Assessment Questions (Internal):**
1. Who is the buyer? (competitor, PE firm, strategic acquirer, individual?)
2. How did they find you?
3. What's their track record of acquisitions?
4. Is this an inbound or were you prospecting?
5. What's your gut feeling?

**Step 2: Craft Initial Response (Within 48 Hours)**

**Template Response:**
```
Hi {{BUYER_NAME}},

Thank you for your interest in {{PROJECT_NAME}}. We're always open to
exploring strategic opportunities with the right partner.

Before we proceed, I'd like to understand a bit more about your interest:

1. What specifically attracted you to {{PROJECT_NAME}}?
2. What's your vision for the business post-acquisition?
3. Have you acquired similar businesses before?
4. What's your timeline for this process?

I'll be happy to schedule a brief call to discuss further once I have
a better sense of alignment.

Best,
{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Goals of Initial Response:**
- Qualify the buyer without seeming desperate

## Negotiation Strategy

### Power Position Fundamentals

**Your Sources of Power:**
1. **You're profitable** (not desperate)
2. **Business runs without you** (lower risk for buyer)
3. **Multiple potential buyers** (competition)
4. **Strong growth trajectory** (FOMO)
5. **You're willing to walk away** (ultimate power)

**Maintain Power By:**
- Never seeming desperate
- Taking time to respond
- Consulting advisors (shows you're sophisticated)
- Having alternatives (even if you don't)
- Being willing to say no

### The Aggressive Anchor

**Philosophy:** First person to mention a number often loses. But if you do mention a number, make it aggressive.

**Anchoring Strategy:**
1. **Delay price discussion** as long as possible
2. **Make them name a price first** (preferred)
3. **If you must anchor**, go {{ANCHOR_MULTIPLE}}× higher than you'd accept

**Example:**
- Your internal target: ${{INTERNAL_TARGET}}
- Your aggressive anchor: ${{AGGRESSIVE_ANCHOR}}
- Expected counteroffer: ${{EXPECTED_COUNTER}}
- Final settlement: ${{EXPECTED_FINAL}} (above your target)

**Script for Deflecting Price Question:**
```
"I appreciate you asking about valuation. Before we discuss numbers,
I'd like to better understand your vision for the business and the
strategic value it brings to your portfolio. The right price depends
on the structure and strategic fit. Can you share more about your
plans post-acquisition?"
```

### Don't Open with Price

**Better Opening Anchors:**
1. **Strategic value**: "Given the synergies with your existing portfolio,
   this acquisition could add ${{SYNERGY_VALUE}} in value to you."
2. **Revenue multiple**: "Similar businesses in our space are trading at
   {{MULTIPLE_RANGE}}× ARR."
3. **Opportunity cost**: "We're projecting ${{PROJECTED_ARR}} ARR in 18 months
   if we stay independent."

### Walk-Away Power

**Establish Walk-Away Power:**
- "We're profitable and growing. A sale is interesting but not necessary."
- "We have several other conversations happening." (even if you don't)
- "The business is running great. We're only interested if it's a strong fit."

**Actual Walk-Away Triggers:**
- Price below ${{WALK_AWAY_PRICE}}
- Earnout > {{MAX_EARNOUT_PCT}}% of total deal
- Non-compete > {{MAX_NON_COMPETE}} years
- Buyer won't provide proof of funds
- Buyer reputation is questionable

---

## Price Negotiation

### Revenue Multiple Strategy

**Your Comparable Research:**
- Industry standard multiple: {{INDUSTRY_MULTIPLE}}× ARR
- Recent comparable sales: {{COMP_MULTIPLE_RANGE}}×
- Your business quality score: {{QUALITY_SCORE}}/10
- Your justified multiple: {{JUSTIFIED_MULTIPLE}}×

**Target Valuation Calculation:**
```
Base: ${{ARR}} × {{BASE_MULTIPLE}} = ${{BASE_VALUATION}}
Growth Adjustment: +{{GROWTH_ADJUSTMENT}}%
Margin Adjustment: +{{MARGIN_ADJUSTMENT}}%
Risk Adjustment: -{{RISK_ADJUSTMENT}}%

Target Valuation: ${{TARGET_VALUATION}}
```

**Negotiation Range:**
- **Walk Away:** < ${{WALK_AWAY_PRICE}}
- **Acceptable:** ${{ACCEPTABLE_PRICE}} - ${{TARGET_PRICE}}
- **Ideal:** ${{IDEAL_PRICE}}+

### Counter-Offer Strategy

**When Buyer Makes Low Offer:**

**Step 1: Don't React Emotionally**
- "Thank you for the offer. Let me review and get back to you."

**Step 2: Justify Your Higher Number**
```
"I appreciate your offer of ${{THEIR_OFFER}}. However, based on:

1. Our growth rate of {{GROWTH_RATE}}% (industry average: {{INDUSTRY_AVG}}%)
2. Our profit margin of {{MARGIN}}% (industry average: {{INDUSTRY_MARGIN}}%)
3. Our churn rate of {{CHURN}}% (industry average: {{INDUSTRY_CHURN}}%)
4. Recent comparable sales at {{COMP_MULTIPLE}}× ARR
5. The strategic value of our customer base to your business

A more appropriate valuation would be ${{COUNTER_OFFER}}.

I'm happy to walk through the math together."
```

**Step 3: Create Competition (Real or Perceived)**
- "We have another offer in the ${{OTHER_OFFER}} range."
- "We're in conversations with {{OTHER_BUYER_TYPE}}."
- "We're also considering staying independent given our growth."

### Deal Structure Preferences

**Ideal Deal Structure:**
1. **{{IDEAL_CASH_PCT}}% cash at closing**
2. **{{IDEAL_ESCROW_PCT}}% in escrow** (released after {{ESCROW_PERIOD}} months)
3. **{{IDEAL_EARNOUT_PCT}}% earnout** (max, based on retention only, not growth)
4. **{{IDEAL_EQUITY_PCT}}% equity** in acquirer (if strategic fit)

**Acceptable Range:**
- Cash at closing: {{MIN_CASH_PCT}}% - {{MAX_CASH_PCT}}%
- Escrow: {{MIN_ESCROW_PCT}}% - {{MAX_ESCROW_PCT}}%
- Earnout: 0% - {{MAX_EARNOUT_PCT}}%

**Avoid:**
- Earnouts based on growth (you won't control it)
- Seller financing > {{MAX_SELLER_FINANCING_PCT}}%
- Vesting equity > {{MAX_VESTING_MONTHS}} months
- Clawback provisions

## Negotiation Scripts

### "Your Offer Is Too Low"

```
"I appreciate your offer of ${{THEIR_OFFER}}. I've put together a
detailed analysis showing why the business is worth significantly more.

[Share analysis]

Based on this, I'd be comfortable at ${{YOUR_COUNTER}}. Where can we
find common ground?"
```

### "Too Much Earnout"

```
"I understand you want to tie some compensation to future performance.
However, {{EARNOUT_PCT}}% earnout is outside my comfort zone because:

1. I won't be controlling the business decisions
2. Market conditions could change regardless of business quality
3. Similar deals in this space are {{MARKET_EARNOUT}}% earnout max

I'd be comfortable with {{YOUR_EARNOUT_PCT}}% earnout tied to customer
retention only, not growth. Does that work?"
```

### "Exclusivity Without Breakup Fee"

```
"I'm open to granting exclusivity, but given that I'd be pausing other
conversations and opportunities, I'd need a {{BREAKUP_FEE_AMOUNT}}
breakup fee if you walk away without cause.

This protects both of us and shows commitment to the process."
```

### "Final Price Negotiation"

```
"We're at ${{THEIR_FINAL}} and I'm at ${{YOUR_FINAL}}. That's a
${{DIFFERENCE}} gap.

I'm willing to meet you halfway at ${{SPLIT_DIFFERENCE}} if we can:
1. {{SWEETENER_1}}
2. {{SWEETENER_2}}

Deal?"
```
