### Pricing Psychology

**Price Points by Impulse Level:**
- $0.99: Minimal friction, highest conversion (15-30%)

### Revenue Examples

**Mobile Game Micro-transactions:**
- 100,000 daily active users (DAU)
- 3% paying users = 3,000 payers
- Average transaction: $4.99
- Monthly transactions per payer: 2
- Monthly revenue: 3,000 × $4.99 × 2 = $29,940

### Pros
- Low barrier to purchase
