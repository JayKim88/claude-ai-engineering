Cost: $6,000-24,000 total (12 months)
Revenue in Month 12: $250-1,000
Revenue in Year 2: $3,000-10,000+/month

## 2. Social Media Marketing

### Platform Selection

**Choose 1-2 platforms based on your audience:**

### Twitter Strategy (B2B Tech)

#### Content Mix (10 tweets/day)
```

- 2 tweets: Personal experiences/stories
- 2 tweets: Industry insights/commentary
- 1 tweet: Engagement (ask questions)
- 1 tweet: Content promotion (blog, product)
- 1 tweet: Curated (reshare others with commentary)

Average Open Rate: 25-35%
Click-Through Rate: 2-5%
Conversion Rate (to customer): 1-3%

Example Calculation:

- Weekly emails: 0.36 × 52 = ~19 customers/year
- Customer value: $50/month
- Annual revenue: 19 × $50 × 12 = $11,400

Cost: $600-2,400/year (tools + lead magnet creation)
ROI: 5-19x

Industry Average: $36-42 for every $1 spent (4,000%+ ROI)
```
