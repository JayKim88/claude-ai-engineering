## 8. Open Source License Considerations

### Choosing a License for Your Code

| License | Allows | Requires | Prohibits |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------|
| MIT | Commercial use, modification, distribution | Copyright notice | Liability, warranty |
| Apache 2.0 | Commercial use, modification, distribution | License notice, state changes | Trademark use, liability |
| GPL v3 | Commercial use, modification, distribution | Disclose source, same license, state changes | Liability, warranty, sublicensing |
| AGPL v3 | Same as GPL v3, plus network use | Same as GPL v3, plus network source disclosure | Same as GPL v3 |
| BSD 3-Clause | Commercial use, modification, distribution | Copyright notice | Use of contributor names |

### Using Open Source in Your Product

**Important considerations:**

```markdown
## Using Open Source Licenses

### Permissive Licenses (MIT, Apache, BSD):
✓ Can use in commercial products
✓ Can modify without releasing source
✓ Must include copyright notice
✓ No warranty

### Copyleft Licenses (GPL, AGPL):
✗ Must release your source code if you distribute
✗ Must use same license for derivative works
⚠️ AGPL: Even network use requires source release

### Audit Your Dependencies:
1. List all npm/pip packages
2. Check licenses (use tools like `license-checker`)
3. Ensure compliance
4. Document license obligations

### Red Flags:
- GPL/AGPL in commercial SaaS (forces open source)
- Missing licenses (assume proprietary, get permission)
- Conflicting license requirements
```

## 10. Legal Mistakes to Avoid

### Common Pitfalls

**1. Copying Terms from Big Companies**
```
Problem: Their terms are designed for their business model
Solution: Use templates designed for startups, customize for your needs
```

**2. No Terms of Service**
```
Problem: Users have no obligations, you have no protections
Solution: Implement basic Terms from day 1
```

**3. Ignoring GDPR/CCPA**
```
Problem: Fines up to 4% of revenue or €20 million
Solution: Implement compliant Privacy Policy, get consent, honor deletion requests
```

**4. Not Protecting Your IP**
```
Problem: Others can copy your product, name, or logo
Solution: Trademark your name/logo ($225-400), copyright your content (automatic)
```

**5. No Contract with Co-Founders**
```
Problem: Disputes over equity, roles, or IP ownership
Solution: Founder's Agreement from day 1, vesting schedules
```

**6. Contractor vs Employee Misclassification**
```
Problem: IRS penalties, back taxes, lawsuits
Solution: Use proper employment agreements, understand IRS tests
```

**7. Not Getting IP Assignment from Contractors**
```
Problem: Contractor owns the code/design they created
Solution: IP assignment clause in every contractor agreement
```

**8. Accepting Investment Without Legal Review**
```
Problem: Unfavorable terms you're stuck with forever
Solution: Always have lawyer review term sheets
```
