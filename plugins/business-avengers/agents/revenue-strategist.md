## Pricing Rationale

### Competitive Positioning
| Tier | Our Price | Competitor A | Competitor B | Position |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Starter | $29/mo | $25/mo | $35/mo | Mid-market |
| Professional | $99/mo | $79/mo | $149/mo | Value |
| Enterprise | Custom | $299/mo | Custom | Premium |

**Strategy**: Position Professional tier as best value compared to competitors

### Value-Based Justification

**Starter Tier ($29/mo)**:
- Customer value: Saves 5 hours/week
- Value of time saved: $125/week (at $25/hr)
- Monthly value: ~$500
- Price: $29 (5.8% of value delivered)
- **Value/Price ratio**: 17:1

**Professional Tier ($99/mo)**:
- Customer value: Saves 20 hours/week + enables $2,000/mo in new revenue
- Monthly value: ~$2,500 time + $2,000 revenue = $4,500
- Price: $99 (2.2% of value)
- **Value/Price ratio**: 45:1

## Revenue Projections

### Year 1
- Free users: 100,000
- Starter: 2,000 ([X]% conversion from free)
- Professional: 800 ([X]% conversion from free)
- Enterprise: 50 ([X]% of paying customers)

**MRR**: (2,000 × $29) + (800 × $99) + (50 × $500) = $162,200
**ARR**: $1,946,400

### Year 2
- Free users: 300,000
- Starter: 8,000
- Professional: 3,500
- Enterprise: 200

**MRR**: $637,500
**ARR**: $7,650,000

### Year 3
- Free users: 750,000
- Starter: 20,000
- Professional: 10,000
- Enterprise: 500

**MRR**: $1,820,000
**ARR**: $21,840,000

## Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- **Freemium signup CAC**: $5 (marketing spend / free signups)
- **Free → Paid CAC**: $25 (includes nurture costs)
- **Direct sales CAC**: $500 (for Enterprise)

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Starter Tier**:
- ARPU: $29/mo
- Average lifetime: 12 months
- Gross margin: 80%
- **LTV**: $29 × 12 × 0.80 = $278

**Professional Tier**:
- ARPU: $99/mo
- Average lifetime: 24 months
- Gross margin: 85%
- **LTV**: $99 × 24 × 0.85 = $2,019

**Enterprise Tier**:
- ARPU: $500/mo
- Average lifetime: 36 months
- Gross margin: 90%
- **LTV**: $500 × 36 × 0.90 = $16,200

### LTV:CAC Ratios
- **Starter**: $278 / $25 = 11.1:1 ✓ Excellent
- **Professional**: $2,019 / $25 = 80:1 ✓ Excellent
- **Enterprise**: $16,200 / $500 = 32.4:1 ✓ Excellent

**Target**: LTV:CAC > 3:1 (All tiers exceed target)

### CAC Payback Period
- **Starter**: $25 / ($29 × 0.80) = 1.1 months ✓
- **Professional**: $25 / ($99 × 0.85) = 0.3 months ✓
- **Enterprise**: $500 / ($500 × 0.90) = 1.1 months ✓

**Target**: < 12 months (All tiers well below target)

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring
- Enterprise tier anchors higher value
- Shows Professional as "best value"
- Free tier anchors zero, making paid tiers seem more accessible

### Decoy Effect
- Professional tier designed as "sweet spot"
- Starter tier positioned as limited (decoy to push to Professional)
- Most customers expected to choose Professional

### Annual Billing Incentive
- 17-20% discount for annual billing
- Improves cash flow
- Reduces churn (commitment)
- Typical uptake: 40% choose annual

## Discounting Policy

### Allowed Discounts
- **Annual billing**: 17-20% (standard)
- **Non-profit**: 25% off
- **Education**: 30% off
- **Volume**: 10-15% for 50+ seats (Enterprise only)
- **Promotional**: Up to 20% for limited campaigns

### NOT Allowed
- ✗ Permanent discounts below 30% of list price
- ✗ Discounts on Professional tier (protect positioning)
- ✗ Random discounts without approval

## Pricing Experiments

### Planned A/B Tests
1. **Test annual discount**: 15% vs 20% vs 25%
   - Hypothesis: 20% is optimal (higher conversion, acceptable margin)

2. **Test Professional price**: $99 vs $89 vs $109
   - Hypothesis: $99 is optimal psychological price point

3. **Test add-ons**: Offer advanced features as add-ons vs included
   - Hypothesis: Add-ons increase ARPU by 15%

## Price Communication

### Value Messaging
- **Lead with value**, not price
- Emphasize ROI and time saved
- Show cost comparison vs. alternatives
- Highlight "money-back guarantee" to reduce risk

### Price Increase Strategy
- Grandfather existing customers for 12 months
- Announce 60 days in advance
- Communicate value improvements justifying increase
- Target price increase: 10% annually (aligned with value delivery)

## Success Metrics
- **Average contract value (ACV)**: [Target]
- **Revenue per user (ARPU)**: [Target]
- **Paid conversion rate**: [X]% of free users
- **Annual billing adoption**: 40%+
- **Expansion revenue**: 20% of total revenue from upsells

## Next Steps
1. Implement pricing on website and in product
2. Train sales team on pricing positioning
3. Set up A/B tests for key pricing variables
4. Monitor metrics and iterate monthly
5. Conduct pricing review every 6 months
