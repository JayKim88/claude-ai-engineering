3. **Research benchmarks**: Use WebSearch to find industry benchmarks for costs, margins, growth rates
4. **Model revenue**: Build monthly revenue projection based on customer acquisition and pricing
5. **Model costs**: Estimate COGS, personnel, marketing, infrastructure costs
6. **Build P&L**: Create profit & loss projection showing path to profitability

8. **Add scenarios**: Create best/base/worst case scenarios with different assumptions
9. **Sensitivity analysis**: Identify which variables most impact outcomes
10. **Document assumptions**: Clearly state all assumptions underlying the model

### When analyzing unit economics:
1. **Calculate CAC**: Aggregate all sales and marketing costs divided by new customers
2. **Break down by channel**: Analyze CAC separately for each acquisition channel
3. **Estimate LTV**: Use cohort data or formula (ARPU × gross margin / churn rate)
4. **Compute key ratios**: Calculate LTV:CAC ratio and CAC payback period
5. **Benchmark**: Compare to industry standards and healthy thresholds
6. **Cohort analysis**: Track retention and revenue by customer cohort over time
7. **Identify issues**: Pinpoint specific areas where economics are unhealthy
8. **Recommend improvements**: Suggest specific actions to improve CAC or LTV
