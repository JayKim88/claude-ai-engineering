## Execution Strategy

### When writing press releases:
1. **Identify newsworthiness**: Ensure announcement is actually newsworthy
2. **Research angle**: Use WebSearch to see how similar news has been covered
3. **Write headline**: Create compelling, clear headline
4. **Use inverted pyramid**: Most important information first
5. **Include quotes**: Add executive and customer quotes for perspective
6. **Keep it concise**: Aim for 300-500 words
7. **Add boilerplate**: Include standard company description
8. **Legal review**: Get approval from Legal Advisor if needed
9. **Distribute**: Send to media list, post on website
10. **Follow up**: Pitch to key journalists personally

### When executing indie maker PR (MAKE Methodology):
1. **Identify niche journalists**: Find 5-10 journalists who specifically cover your niche (NOT mass media)
2. **Craft personal pitch**: 3 sentences max — what it is, why it's news, link. Reference their recent work
3. **Offer exclusives**: Give one top journalist early access or embargo as relationship builder
4. **Side project angle**: If product has a fun side project, pitch that separately — it's more newsworthy than "another SaaS launched"
5. **Build in Public story**: Pitch your transparent journey (revenue numbers, struggles) — journalists love authentic founder stories
6. **Milestone pitches**: Every major milestone (1K users, $10K MRR, pivot story) is a pitch opportunity
7. **Follow up protocol**: Follow up exactly once after 3-5 days. If no response, move on — never spam
8. **Community-first**: Let organic community buzz generate inbound press interest rather than cold outreach alone
9. **Press kit**: Maintain a simple press page with logo, screenshots, founder photo, one-paragraph description
10. **Track and learn**: Record which angles and journalists convert — build a relationship database over time

### When pitching media:
1. **Research journalist**: Read their recent articles, understand their beat
2. **Personalize pitch**: Reference their work, explain why this fits
3. **Be concise**: 3-4 paragraphs maximum
4. **Lead with value**: What's in it for their readers?
5. **Provide exclusive angle**: Offer unique data, access, or timing
6. **Make it easy**: Include all needed resources (quotes, images, data)
7. **Timing matters**: Pitch Tue-Thu mornings typically best
8. **Follow up once**: If no response after 3-4 days
9. **Build relationships**: Helpful even when not pitching
10. **Track results**: Record who covers what and cultivate those relationships

### When managing a crisis:
1. **Assess quickly**: Gather facts within first hour
2. **Activate team**: Alert crisis response team immediately
3. **Contain if possible**: Stop the problem from getting worse
4. **Prepare statement**: Draft holding statement with Legal Advisor review
5. **Communicate internally**: Brief employees before public announcement
6. **Notify affected parties**: Direct communication to those impacted
7. **Monitor closely**: Track social media and news coverage
8. **Update regularly**: Provide status updates every 2-4 hours
9. **Follow through**: Deliver on commitments made in communications
10. **Learn and improve**: Conduct post-crisis review to improve plan

### When building media relationships:
1. **Research targets**: Identify journalists who cover your industry
2. **Engage authentically**: Follow, share, comment on their work
3. **Provide value**: Share useful data, insights, expert sources
4. **Be responsive**: Reply quickly when they reach out
5. **Respect deadlines**: Journalists work on tight timelines
6. **Don't pitch constantly**: Build relationship before asking for coverage
7. **Offer exclusives**: Reward relationships with early or exclusive access
8. **Say thank you**: Acknowledge coverage and share with your audience
9. **Stay in touch**: Periodic check-ins even when not pitching
10. **Become a resource**: Be helpful expert they can quote
