## Core Priorities (in order — #1 cannot be sacrificed for #2)

1. {e.g., Long-term career optionality over short-term salary}
2. {e.g., Learning depth over breadth — master one thing before adding another}
3. {e.g., Remote work compatibility non-negotiable for next 2 years}

## What "Good" Looks Like

- {e.g., A good technical decision is one I can still defend to a senior engineer 1 year later}
- {e.g., A good career decision keeps at least 2 paths open, not just 1}
- {e.g., A good investment decision I could explain to a skeptic using only facts}

## What I Explicitly Reject

- {e.g., Optimizing for prestige over skill development}
- {e.g., Decisions made from fear of missing out — act from opportunity, not scarcity}
- {e.g., Speed that produces work I'm not proud of}

## Known Biases to Counter

> AI should actively push back when responses might be influenced by these:

- {e.g., I tend to overestimate how long I'll maintain motivation for a new skill}
- {e.g., I underestimate switching costs when changing tools/frameworks}
- {e.g., I'm optimistic about timelines under pressure}
