## Fixed Constraints (cannot be changed — do not re-open these)

| Constraint | Value | Reason |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Location | {e.g., Seoul, South Korea — remote only} | {e.g., Visa/family} |
| Timeline | {e.g., 6 months to career transition} | {e.g., Financial runway} |
| Budget | {e.g., $X/month for tools/courses} | {e.g., Current savings} |
| Language | {e.g., English required for target market} | {e.g., Remote job requirement} |

## Soft Constraints (can be changed, but default to honoring)

| Constraint | Value | Override condition |
|------------|-------|--------------------|
| {e.g., Framework} | {e.g., Prefer TypeScript ecosystem} | {e.g., Compelling AI use case} |
| {e.g., Complexity} | {e.g., Avoid adding new infra unless essential} | {e.g., >10x improvement} |

## Already-Decided Matters (do not re-litigate)

These decisions have been made. AI should not reopen them unless asked:

- {e.g., Target role: AI Product Engineer (not pure ML)}
- {e.g., No relocation until 2027}
- {e.g., Side project focus: market-pulse (not a new project)}

## Current Known Risks

> Factors that make the above constraints potentially fragile:

- {e.g., Financial runway depends on freelance income which is variable}
- {e.g., 6-month timeline assumes no health/family interruptions}
