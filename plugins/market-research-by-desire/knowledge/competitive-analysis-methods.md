# Competitive Analysis Methods

## SWOT Framework

### Template
| Dimension | Questions to Answer |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Strengths** | What do they do well? Brand, tech, UX, pricing, distribution |
| **Weaknesses** | Where do users complain? Feature gaps, high churn, poor support |
| **Opportunities** | What markets/segments are they ignoring? Unmet needs |
| **Threats** | What could disrupt them? New tech, regulation, competitor moves |

### Extraction Strategy (from WebSearch/WebFetch)
- **Strengths:** Homepage value props, awards, user reviews (4-5 stars)
- **Weaknesses:** 1-3 star reviews, Reddit complaints, Glassdoor insights
- **Opportunities:** Blog/roadmap (what they're NOT building), market expansions
- **Threats:** Press releases (funding announcements = incoming competition)

## Feature Comparison Matrix

### Core Feature Categories
- **Core functionality** (해당 욕망 충족 정도)
- **Ease of use** (온보딩, UI/UX)
- **Pricing** (free tier, premium tiers, enterprise)
- **Integration** (API, third-party tools)
- **Support** (커뮤니티, 고객지원)
- **Mobile** (앱 여부, 기능 동등성)
- **Localization** (한국어 지원, 결제 수단)

### Scoring System
- ✅ Fully supported
- ⚠️ Partial/limited
- ❌ Not available
- ❓ Unknown

## Positioning Map (2x2 Matrix)

### Common Axes
| X-Axis | Y-Axis | Market Type |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Price (Low → High) | Features (Few → Many) | SaaS, consumer tech |
| Ease of Use (Complex → Simple) | Customization (Low → High) | Enterprise tools |
| Breadth (Niche → Broad) | Depth (Shallow → Deep) | Marketplaces |

### Opportunity Zones
- **Underserved quadrants:** No competitors plotted
- **Cluster avoidance:** Where 5+ competitors overlap = red ocean
- **Wedge entry:** Adjacent to cluster, slightly differentiated

## Competitor Categorization

| Type | Definition | Strategy Against |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Direct** | Same desire + same solution | Differentiate on micro-features, pricing |
| **Indirect** | Same desire + different solution | Highlight solution superiority |
| **Potential** | Adjacent market, could pivot | Monitor, prepare for entry |
| **Substitute** | Different desire, similar outcome | Educate on your approach |

## Pricing Analysis

### Metrics to Extract
- **Entry price:** Lowest paid tier
- **Avg. price:** Median tier most users choose (often tier 2 of 3)
- **Premium price:** Highest tier or enterprise (contact sales)
- **Pricing model:** Freemium, tiered, usage-based, flat fee

### Benchmark Table Format
| Competitor | Model | Entry | Avg | Premium | Annual Discount |
|------------|-------|-------|-----|---------|-----------------|
| A | Freemium | $0 | $15 | $99 | 20% |
| B | Tiered | $10 | $30 | Contact | 15% |

## Red Flags (Avoid These Markets)

| Signal | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| 10+ similar competitors all <2 years old | Hype cycle, likely shakeout coming |
| Market leader has >60% share | Winner-take-all, hard to displace |
| Frequent pivots in top 5 players | Unclear value prop, market not mature |
| All competitors funded (no bootstrapped) | High CAC market, requires capital |
