## Installation

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Projects/claude-ai-engineering
npm run link
```

This creates symlinks for the career-compass plugin.

## Usage

### Trigger Phrases

```
"analyze my career"
"career path recommendation"
"how do I transition to AI Engineer"
"/career-compass"
```

### Recommended Setup

**Step 1: Create your profile**
```
/jd-analyzer
```
This collects job descriptions and creates `~/.jd-analyzer/profile.yaml`.

**Step 2: Run career analysis**
```
/career-compass
```

### Generated Files

📄 Detailed Learning Roadmap
   File: ~/.career-compass/roadmaps/roadmap-path1-2026-02-14.md

📄 Strategic Career Advice
   File: ~/.career-compass/strategy/strategy-2026-02-14.md
```

## Configuration

Edit `config/agent-config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
# Timeouts
timeouts:
  career_trend_researcher: 180  # Increase if web search is slow

# Resources (if on budget)
resources:
  prioritize_free_resources: true
  max_course_cost: 0

# Features
features:
  enable_web_research: true
  enable_salary_projection: true
```

## Requirements

- **jd-analyzer plugin** (highly recommended): Provides job market data
- **Profile**: `~/.jd-analyzer/profile.yaml` with your skills/experience

### Without jd-analyzer

Plugin will use web search fallback (slower, less personalized).

## Troubleshooting

### "jd-analyzer data not found"
```bash
# Run jd-analyzer first (recommended)
/jd-analyzer
```

### "Agent timeout"
- Increase timeout in `config/agent-config.yaml`
- Check internet connection
- Verify `~/.jd-analyzer/` data is recent

### "Cannot write files"
```bash
# Create directories manually
mkdir -p ~/.career-compass/{roadmaps,strategy,sessions}
chmod 755 ~/.career-compass
```

## Performance

- Phase 1: 90-120s (3 agents in parallel)
- Phase 2: 90-120s (3 agents in parallel)
- Phase 3: 120-180s (2 agents sequential)
- **Total:** 5-7 minutes
